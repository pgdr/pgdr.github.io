      <description>&lt;p&gt;Current status&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Pål Grønås Drange, researcher in the the Algorithms group, Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received my PhD from the University after defending my thesis &amp;ldquo;Parameterized Graph Modification Algorithms&amp;rdquo;, which was supervised by Professor Fedor V. Fomin. My scholarship during the PhD period came from Fomin&amp;rsquo;s ERC Advanced Grant Rigorous Theory of Preprocessing, ERC Advanced Investigator Grant 267959.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a PhD student from January 2012 until January 2016. October 5th I handed in my PhD thesis, Parameterized Graph Modification Algorithms and defended this thesis December 10, 2015. See the press release Kunsten å avdekke strukturer i komplekse nettverk (Norwegian) and the disputas announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From February until May 2015, I visited Serge Gaspers at NICTA, Sydney and UNSW in Sydney, Australia.
Research interest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main interest is algorithmic graph theory, parameterized complexity, preprocessing (in the form of kernelization and width parameter analysis) and exact (sub-)exponential algorithms. Especially for graph modification problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graph modification problem is a problem where you are given a graph G and a budget k and you are asked to transform G to some specific target class (usually a graph class characterized by either forbidden minors, or forbidden induced subgraphs), modifying at most k vertices or edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph classes of particular interest are graphs related to chordal graphs, or graphs omitting P4, C4, C5 or 2K2 as induced subgraphs. Graph classes of these types include (pseudo-)split, threshold and chain graphs, trivially perfect and cographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of results, we have given subexponential exact algorithms for Trivially Perfect Completion, Threshold Completion, and Pseudosplit Completion. (STACS 2014)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have shown that Trivially Perfect Editing is NP-hard and does not have a subexponential algorithm unless ETH fails, but that it, on the positive side, admits a polynomial kernel (preprint at arXiv).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have shown that Threshold Editing and Chain Editing are NP-hard, but that on the positive side, they admit quadratic kernels and subexponential algorithms(to appear). The quadratic kernels also hold for the completion and deletion variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a slightly different type of problem, in the area of graph vulnerability, we showed that Vertex Integrity is NP-complete, on cocomparability graphs (even on co-bipartite graphs), thereby refuting a twenty year old conjecture, and that Component Order Connectivity can be solved in lkn time, where l is the size of the largest connected component in the target graph and k is the budget. (ISAAC 2014)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we showed that there is a single-exponential linear time constant factor approximation for computing the treewidth of a graph, i.e., we can in time O(ctn) time obtain a 5-approximation of the treewidth of an input graph G. (FOCS 2013)

&lt;p&gt;Education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a PhD from the Algorithms group at the Department of Informatics, University of Bergen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bachelor and master degree both come from the University of Bergen, with a short stay at the ILLC at the University of Amsterdam. In 2009, I finished my bachelor degree in Cognitive science and in 2011, I completed my master thesis Epistemic Effectivity: Neighborhood Semantics for Coalitional Ability and Group Knowledge under the supervision of Professor Thomas Ågotnes.&lt;/p&gt;
